				 "We aspire to be the most player-focused game company in the world. We were established in 2006 by a couple of entrepreneurial gamers who believe player-focused game development can result in awesome games. In 2009, we released our debut title, League of Legends, to critical and player acclaim. Over 67 million play every month." - <a href="http://www.riotgames.com/">Riot Games</a>

				At Riot, I served as a Development Management Intern on the Gameplay Initiative. A large focus of my summer was serving as the Lead DM on Season 2016, a major yearly update released for League of Legends. As Lead DM, I coordinated work between teams, assisted in visualizing workflow, regularly identified and removed roadblocks, and rose visibility on risks and changes of scope.

			<p>
				I worked on the Game Systems team, learning how to be a DM on the team level. I assisted with story
				mapping, sprint estimation and planning, backlog grooming, and other assorted ceremonies.
			</p><br>	

			<p>
				I also spend a large amount of time on work aimed toward leveling up my discipline of Development Management. I wrote several DM "how tos", and ran a workshop centered around Developer Efficiency at Riot.
