Notez
ICEBREAKER: What do you want to see most in CAF this semester
Alex: Fer sure, working with mah bois.
Kyle: I'm most excited to see just how the program shapes up really, I think it's going to be more or less a mystery for now.
Griffin: Something cool I'm sure
Justin: I'm excited to get the coaching program off the ground *Shameless Plug*
Imani: I'm excited to see how everything we're worried about ends up playing out
Leeann: I'm excited for the callers to be pumped for our new model, and Will and I will get the best five people we can get
Nicole: I'm excited to hang out with all of you guys, and to see how all these changes shape how people in the Cornell Community view the Annual Fund
Ava: I'm excited for my name badge. Working with all of you, it's going to be very different to be working as an MT member.
Julia: I'm excited to get closer to more callers with a smaller group
Spencer (or Skyler?): I'm excited to use our rebranding ideas to make CAF the best job on campus
Caile: My first thought was that we don't need to worry about back of the room entertainment. Our strats toward room entertainment will change positively.
Brielle: Smaller room will allow us to get to know more callers
Eric: I'm excited to know people better and to know all of you better
Skyler (probably?) Knowing people on shift better
Will: A new role is really interesting
Jon: New motivational programs that we come up with
Lana: Leading those new motivational programs
Cait: I'm excited about everything


MT Calling Shift Successes and Failures
Ruffalo Cody Levitz (still can't take it seriously) probably understands most of our problems now
Everyone knows how to set up and turn down shift. 

Challenges in the future are calling more Nons and having a slower night but we'll be able to get closer to callers.
