                <div class="box"> <h3>Cloud</h3>
                <p>I did this project with my friend Max as part of the <a href="http://0hgame.eu/">0hr</a> Game Jam. We made this game in the extra hour gained by daylight savings time. Max provided all the artwork as I coded the game. It was super interesting to code under the constraint of having only an hour, it changed a lot of the usual process. Cloud ended up being an art game about the power of abundance and not having enough. The finished product can be found <a href="Cloud.swf">here.</a></p>

                <div class="box"> <h3>Zombie Toddler Brawl</h3>
                <p>The idea for this silly flash game came from an Internet joke, namely "How many toddlers do you think you could take on in a fight?" The concept was a bit barbaric, so I changed it to zombie toddlers, to make it okay. I programmed all of this, and made my own art, except for several menu buttons, donated from a friend. This project ended up being a good way to learn about the software development process, and I learned a lot about computer art as well.</p>

                <p>In high school, I worked on two senior projects. For this project, my group designed a computer peripheral, that gave information to the computer about how it was being held. We used an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) inside a plastic cube, and used dead reckoning to keep the position  and orientation of the cube. My part of the project was the physics and visual representation of the cube, I used Quaternions and VPython to show the cube and the changes applied to it .</p>

                <div class="box"> <h3>Boids</h3>
                <p>My other senior project was a simulation of Craig Reynold's 1986 <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/"> Boids experiment</a> . We gave a few actors on a stage a  few simple rules, such as "All boids tend to move toward the center of motion". All of these simple rules together created complex behaviors, flocking behavior in this case. This was an example of emergent property. My partner handled the integration and calculus, and I wrote the logical rules and implemented our GUI..</p>
