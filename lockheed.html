				I spent two summers interning at Lockheed Martin. For my first summer, I worked on Technical Operations. I worked on an Event-Driven System Simulation. I implemented software updates in C++ to increase code maintainability, and
				reduce redundancy. I wrote Bash scripts to maintain our development environment, and created an automatic documentation generator for our code base. A security clearance was required.

			</p><br>
			
			<p>
				In my second summer, I worked as a full stack developer using Linux server for production and a Windows environment for development. I used Java Persistence API (JPA) with the Hibernate Engine for the data model on top of MySQL, and developed a user interface using Eclipse RAP framework to deliver a browser based solution on a closed network. I served as a Full Lifecycle developer responsible for interfacing with customers and implementing requirements. A security clearance was required.
