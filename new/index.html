<h1>LEADERSHIP </h1>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;I believe that great leadership looks like using every aspect of yourself, body and mind, in service of others. I think that great leaders inspire, teach, and drive others, so that a team can accomplish more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;One thing I believe embodies the spirit of leadership is the concept of <b>Arete</b>, an ancient Greek term. There's no direct translation, but it resembles a mixture of Efficiency and Moral Virtue. "A man or woman of Arete is a person of the highest effectiveness; they use all of their faculties - strength, bravery and wit - to achieve real results."</p>  
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Arete resonates strongly with me, and my opinion of what leaders should be and do. Throughout my Engineering Leadership Program, I have attempted to obtain the skills, knowledge, and understanding needed to be an effective leader. The following represents my journey on this path, and all of the insights I have gained along the way.  </p>

  	<h1> SAGE </h1>
	<p>In our leadership program, we've spent a large amount of time discovering and understanding the impact we have on others when we are in a leadership position. I have come to learn, from my peers, that my style most emulates that of a "Sage". When I'm around, allegedly I make others feel at ease, and reassure them that things will be taken care of. It gives me an inherent authority, and helps me connect to and engage with others. I try to use this knowledge to be more intentional when I'm a leader, and know how to use my own unique strengths. For example, I recently attended a personal branding workshop, where the desired outputs were three phrases to keep in mind, so as to be intentional as to how we can be perceived in the workplace. My personal three were Insightfully Nurturing, Sincerely Connected, and Empathetically Lighthearted. These represent what I think my strengths are in team settings, and influence situations. I would consciously change my behavior and make sure that I play up  both my "sagely" leadership presence, by being a teacher, and quietly empowering, and by focusing on my relationships with others, to build sincere connections and nurture others. </p>

	<h1> PURPOSE </h1>
	<p>I joined the leadership program at the beginning of this year to discover what my pasisons were, and to hone in on my calling in life. My main goals were to figure out, as corny as it sounds, my "life's purpose". I was thrilled when this was a topic of class early on, our "compelling purpose", defined as the intersection of what the world needs and what we hunger for. The theory is that no one can lead a team effectively for any sustainable amount of time without a compelling purpose. Through much meditation, thought, journaling, and consultations, I realized that I had always been deeply passionate about mental wellness. When I was little, I had always wanted to be a psychiatrist, but I was quickly told I'd either have to go to med school or not make enough money, discouraging to younger me. I realized how much I loved helping people, relating my own experiences, and trying to relieve the storm that some people experience in their minds. I never feel better than when I'm helping others, and I'm beginning to have the knowledge and experience to make a significant difference. In my free time I daydream about starting a mental health support group in my new job, or at becoming certified as a coach to assist others in their every day lives. I'm excited to see where my passion for mental wellness takes me next.</p>

	<h1>CORE VALUES</h1>
	<p>My absolutely favorite activity that I've done in my leadership program was a discussion and identification of my values. Erica Dawson and I sat down for two hours, the first of which we spent with just me telling her stories. I told stories about times I was feeling amazing, satisfied, fulfilled, and why. I told stories about when I felt punched in the gut, like everything was wrong, and why. After this first hour, Erica listed at least sixty different words, all words that came out as possible values of mine. I then sorted them, modified some, erased any that felt off base to me, and was left with my most core values, those that drive me, the ones I feel incredible when I satisfy, and awful when I violate.</p>
	<p>The values that are most core to me are Connection, TODO</p>

<div id = "mineText" class = "wow bounceInUp">On my leadership journey, I know that many potential challenges will arise, and many factors will seek to derail me. To the left, I have highlighted some of my potential derailers, as well as the factors that I know will keep me "on track". An important facet of leadership is understanding why we make the decisions we do, and what we can do about that. My derailers are things that might keep me from being the best leader I could be, and my course correctors are the things that I know will keep me moving in the right direction.</div>
