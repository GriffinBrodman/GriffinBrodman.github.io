<h1>LEADERSHIP </h1>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;I believe that great leadership looks like using every aspect of yourself, body and mind, in service of others. I think that great leaders inspire, teach, and drive others, so that a team can accomplish more than the sum of their parts.</p>
<p>&emsp;&emsp;One thing I believe embodies the spirit of leadership is the concept of <b>Arete</b>, an ancient Greek term. There's no direct translation, but it resembles a mixture of efficiency and moral virtue. "A man or woman of Arete is a person of the highest effectiveness; they use all of their faculties - strength, bravery and wit - to achieve real results."</p>  
<p>&emsp;&emsp;Arete resonates strongly with me, and my opinion of what leaders should be and do. Throughout my Engineering Leadership Program, I have attempted to obtain the skills, knowledge, and understanding needed to be an effective leader. The following represents my journey on this path, and all of the insights I have gained along the way.  </p>

<div id = "strengths" class = "wow bounceInUp"> <h1 style="color: C77966;"> WHO I AM </h1>
<div class = "strengthSection">

  	<h1> SAGE </h1>
	<p>In our leadership program, we've spent a large amount of time discovering and understanding the impact we have on others when we are in a leadership position. I have come to learn, from my peers, that my style most emulates that of a "Sage". When I'm around, allegedly I make others feel at ease, and reassure them that things will be taken care of. It gives me an inherent authority, and helps me connect to and engage with others. I try to use this knowledge to be more intentional when I'm a leader, and know how to use my own unique strengths. For example, I recently attended a personal branding workshop, where the desired outputs were three phrases to keep in mind, so as to be intentional as to how we can be perceived in the workplace. My personal three were Insightfully Nurturing, Sincerely Connected, and Empathetically Lighthearted. These represent what I think my strengths are in team settings, and influence situations. I would consciously change my behavior and make sure that I play up  both my "sagely" leadership presence, by being a teacher, and quietly empowering, and by focusing on my relationships with others, to build sincere connections and nurture others. </p>

<div class = "strengthSection">
	<img src="./images/puzzle.svg" width = "80px" class = "strengthIcon">
	<h1>CORE VALUES</h1>
	<p>My favorite activity that I've done in my leadership program was a discussion and identification of my values. Erica Dawson and I sat down for two hours, the first of which we spent just telling stories. I told stories about times I was feeling amazing, satisfied, fulfilled, and why. I told stories about when I felt punched in the gut, like everything was wrong, and why. After this first hour, Erica listed at least sixty different words, all  possible values of mine. I then sorted them, erased and modified some, and was left with my most core values, those that drive me and guide me.
	The values that are most core to me are Connection, Nurturing, Positivity, and Putting the Pieces Together. Connecting with others is what I live for; my favorite types of conversations are deep, personal, and live me with an intimate knowledge of what goes on in a given person's head. Nothing makes me feel more fulfilled than helping others, specially helping others through building them up with knowledge and wisdom, and watching them succeed. I always look on the bright side; I think a sunny disposition is instrumental to leading a happy life, and I get confused when others don't share in my positive convictions. I love organization, and I love finding out how things can fit together. Now that I'm fully aware of my values, I need to make sure to continue to bake these into my every day life, and have the forethought to make my decisions in accordance with my actions. </p>

	<h1> PURPOSE </h1>
	<p>I joined the leadership program at the beginning of this year to discover what my pasisons were, and to hone in on my calling in life. My main goals were to figure out, as corny as it sounds, my "life's purpose". I was thrilled when this was a topic of class early on, our "compelling purpose", defined as the intersection of what the world needs and what we hunger for. The theory is that no one can lead a team effectively for any sustainable amount of time without a compelling purpose. Through much meditation, thought, journaling, and consultations, I realized that I had always been deeply passionate about mental wellness. When I was little, I had always wanted to be a psychiatrist, but I was quickly told I'd either have to go to med school or not make enough money, discouraging to younger me. I realized how much I loved helping people, relating my own experiences, and trying to relieve the storm that some people experience in their minds. I never feel better than when I'm helping others, and I'm beginning to have the knowledge and experience to make a significant difference. In my free time I daydream about starting a mental health support group in my new job, or at becoming certified as a coach to assist others in their every day lives. I'm excited to see where my passion for mental wellness takes me next.</p>

When my anxiety takes over, I forget about how I want to act and who I want to be. When I'm anxious, I'm emotional, reactive, and hopeless. To me it feels like being two different people. I know anxiety is an issue I'll always have ot deal with, but I have made great strides in dealing with it. I've learned multiple coping techniques: cognitive behavioral therapy, disassociation, self compassion, and mindfulness. I wouldn't say I'm cured of anxiety, but now that I have an eye on it, I know I can keep myself moving in the right direction.">

Before the program, I would have dismissed it as 'Courage is not being afraid of scary movies and always doing the right thing'. Now, I realize how important courage is, and how I can use it to become my best self. Courage is pushing yourself to do the things that are uncomfortable to you, and to continually expand your comfort zone. Growth is very important to me, and sometimes I try to grow by learning, but I can continue to improve by doing the scary things I know I should, and add new capabilities to myself. Courage to me involves my relationships with others, and bringing up difficult conversations, and doing the right thing to people I care about.">

Conscious attention to this problem has helped me, along with the support of my friends, gently pointing out if sometimes my ego gets in the way of my growth. In the future, I'll continue to work on the issue, and the more practice I have catching myself, the easier it will continue to be.">

In my mind, I didn't care too much if actions were unethical, I just cared what felt right to me, and what helped people. After our class discussion, I realized the importance of ethics was in understanding what rules I personally use to make decisions. After examining this, I realized that I have a quite simple ethical code: do what helps people. In past situations, I have never minded lying or stealing, if the action was intended to help others. If an action helps more people than it hurts, it is ethical, as a general rule. I think that this code will help me as a leader, and help others understand who I am. On the same note, I need to watch out for where this rule can get me in trouble. I don't ever want to violate the law, or do things others find unethical, and I don't want to be so busy helping others that I neglect myself. If my ethics and the environmental ethics are out of sync with each other, I would probably follow mine to the point it isn't illegal, if the consequences were that it helped significantly more people than it hurt." >

<div id = "mineText" class = "wow bounceInUp">On my leadership journey, I know that many potential challenges will arise, and many factors will seek to derail me. To the left, I have highlighted some of my potential derailers, as well as the factors that I know will keep me "on track". An important facet of leadership is understanding why we make the decisions we do, and what we can do about that. My derailers are things that might keep me from being the best leader I could be, and my course correctors are the things that I know will keep me moving in the right direction.</div>

  	<li><h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  	<p>The Engineering Leadership Program has been an incredible experience for me. I've learned so much about myself, teams, leadership, and how I can help the world. The following pages represent a useful summary of what I've learned.</p></li>

    <li><h2>HOW I HAVE GROWN FROM WORKING WITH MY TEAM</h2>
    <p>I've had a phenomenal time working with my team, and I've learned so much from them. Working with my team helped me understand the balance between contributing when I had something to say, but also leaving room for everyone to be a contributer. I learned about different styles of meetings, and not to make assumptions. Our team struggled through some communication issues at first, but eventually we all landed on the same page, as a well oiled machine. We were able to achieve real change, and only because we worked together so well. I found it great to be able to take a back seat on some activities because I trusted my team so well, and it was a way more efficient way to conduct business. This team was a model team, and as I move on, I'll be sad that I'll be encountering teams that may not be as educated in leadership as the exemplary students I was fortunate to work with.</p></li>

    <li><h2> HOW I HAVE GROWN FROM THIS PROGRAM </h2>
    <p>I have learned an innumerable amount of skills from this program. I learned how to make decisions like an effective leader, and what factors of a decision lead to more or less team involvement. I've learned about the different types of followership, and that to be most helpful to a leader, I should try to stay a bit more positive. I've learned about conflict, and I'm now learning I need to be slightly less accomodating, and slightly more assertive with my own needs. I've learned not to make assumptions, and to mindfully challenge my own perceptions of reality before assuming they are true. All in all, I've found the directions to head in to improve my own leadership skills, and I plan to spend the rest of my career becoming the best leader I can be.</p></li>


    <li><h2>PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL GOALS</h2>
    <p>I cannot wait until next year when my life starts. Immediately, I plan to try to develop a mental wellness club at my new job, a safe space for the discussion of mental wellness, and hopefully be a resource to others in need. I want to be a programmer, and work and save money for the next few years so that after five years, I'll be in a position to make my work decisions a little more based off of my passions, and a little less based off of my financial situation. Longer term, I'm looking into either counseling or coaching as a venue for me to be able to positively impact others lives. Additionally, I think my experience in technology, combined with mental wellness, could be huge. The main issue in mental wellness is that people don't have either the resources to get help nor the knowledge to get help. Technology solves both of these problems, by lowering the cost and the barriers to entry. Hopefully, in the future I can make a meaningful contribution toward my passions.</p></li>
