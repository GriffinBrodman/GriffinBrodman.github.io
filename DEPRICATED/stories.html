				Ever had a story or message you had to share with multiple groups of people? Tired of typing up a story on facebook, then copy pasting it to a friend on Skype, before ultimately texting the entire thing up again to another friend? No more! With Stories, write once, share everywhere.

				For HackNY, my first hackathon, my friend <a href="http://www.jefftao.com">Jeff</a> and I decided we wanted to make a way to easily share stories across different platforms. Our aim was something more minimalist than a blog, something like pastebin but built for stories, or messages. Something that looked really nice, but also something so simple that those less technically inclined would feel comfortable with it.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				Once we got to the hackathon, we ended up drafting two fellow students into our group, <a href="http://charlesjianlai.com/"> Charles</a> and Jen. We then divided into groups, but the workload was light enough that we all got a chance to be involved with every level of development.
			</p><br>
			<p>
				My primary responsibility was setting up, and configuring reading and writing to the database. I looked into MongoDB, and found PyMongo, as we were using python as our backend. Charles headed up the Flask, Jen tackled HTML templates, and Jeff manned the CSS and Ajax.
			</p> <br>
			<p> 
				The repository for our application is <a href="https://github.com/GriffinBrodman/Stories"> here </a> and the app is hosted live <a href="http://www.shareastory.net/"> here</a>.
