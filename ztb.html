				My first attempt at a flash game, I was aiming for an arcade based infinite survival game. The unique mechanic of the game was the combat system, a flail was kept at a fixed distance from the player. As it collides and recoils upon hitting zombies, the optimal way to play is to keep switching rotation directions, leading to a very fluid and responsive control system.

			<p>
				I never got around to finishing the product, but it served as good practice for me. I learned some of the do's and don'ts of architecting a system, and how games / simulations function.

				The game as it currently stands in its unfinished state can be found <a href="media/ToddlerBrawl.swf">here</a>. There still remains a chance I'll go back to it someday.
