		<h2> The First Step </h2>
		
		<hr>
		<br>

		<p> I've always wanted to write a blog. For years, I've wanted a blog. I've thought about writing about coding, video games, cooking; many of my multiple interests. I never got past brainstorming though, and I was never quite sure why. </p>

		<p> After spending my school year learning about psychology and mental wellness, I came back to my thoughts of a blog, and began to brainstorm with friends. I was still reluctant to start. When pushed, I told my friends that I thought it was silly to think that anyone cared what I had to say. They replied by asking what I did have to say </p>

		<p>With the idea ruminating in the back of my mind, I spent a summer at Riot Games. I was a Development Manager; I learned how to get myself and my teammates to work smart and be their best selves. I spent the summer learning organizational and leadership techniques to empower Rioters to excel in the workplace. </p>

		<p> Suddenly it clicked for me. It was all well in good to use these techniques and knowledge to make good workers into better workers, but there were so many other places that this learned science could do good. The young high school boy or girl that listens too much to their inner criic, never having been told that they shouldn't. The middle aged, dead end worker that's too mean to their spouse, who doesn't believe that they have the potential to change, if they adopt a real growth mindset. </p>

		<p> Around the same time, I realized my life was slowly drifting out of balance. Being away from all my friends and family took a toll on me, as I worked 50 hour weeks and spent all my free time at the office too. I decided I too wanted to bring these techniques and lessons into my life, and that a blog would be a great way to be introspective, look at myself and how I was doing things, critically think about things and pivot for future success </p>

		<p> I finally had something to say </p>

		<h2> Planning </h2>

		<p> Caring heavily about the success of my venture, I began to plan my blog like I would any new venture at Riot.
