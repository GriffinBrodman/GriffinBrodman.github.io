		<p>Yeah but George, Lorraine wants to go with you. Give her a break. I'll call you tonight. Yeah. Hey not too early I sleep in Sunday's, hey McFly, you're shoe's untied, don't be so gullible, McFly. Uh, Lorraine. How did you know I was here?</p>

		<p>No, Marty, we've already agreed that having information about the future could be extremely dangerous. Even if your intentions are good, they could backfire drastically. Whatever you've got to tell me I'll find out through the natural course of time. I'm writing this down, this is good stuff. The car, Dad, I mean He wrecked it, totaled it. I needed that car tomorrow night, Dad, I mean do you have any idea how important this was, do you have any clue? Well, safe and sound, now, n good old 1955. Wait a minute, what are you doing, Doc?</p>

		<p>What you got under here? Good, you could start by sweeping the floor. Right. Lou, gimme a milk, chocolate. Lorraine, my density has popped me to you. Hey, Doc? Doc. Hello, anybody home? Einstein, come here, boy. What's going on? Wha- aw, god. Aw, Jesus. Whoa, rock and roll. Yo I just wanna use the phone.</p>

		<p>Oh, pleased to meet you, Calvin Marty Klein. Do you mind if I sit here? Hey boy, are you alright? That's George McFly? Oh, you make it sound so easy. I just, I wish I wasn't so scared. Oh, thank you, thank you. Okay now, we run some industrial strength electrical cable from the top of the clocktower down to spreading it over the street between two lamp posts. Meanwhile, we out-fitted the vehicle with this big pole and hook which runs directly into the flux-capacitor. At the calculated moment, you start off from down the street driving toward the cable execrating to eighty-eight miles per hour. According to the flyer, at !0:04 pm lightning will strike the clocktower sending one point twenty-one gigawatts into the flux-capacitor, sending you back to 1985. Alright now, watch this. You wind up the car and release it, I'll simulate the lightening. Ready, set, release. Huhh.</p>

		<p>I had a horrible nightmare, dreamed I went back in time, it was terrible. What, what is it hot? I have a feeling too. McFly. Stand tall, boy, have some respect for yourself. Don't you know that if you let people walk all over you know, they'll be walking all over you for the rest of your life? Listen to me, do you think I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in this slop house?</p>
